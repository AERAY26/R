# R

I'm including several tutorials from the astrostatistics course. The R_Code 1-4 tutorials are pretty easy to follow and include more beginning material. The website for those tutorials can also be found here: 
https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/su19/program.html

I would also recommend getting either RStudio:

or the R console:

I've also included another tutorial we had on machine learning below:

Materials for the "Illustrating Machine Learning with Random Forest" lecture at the Summer School in Statistics for Astronomers XV at Penn State (7 June 2019).

1. Lab_Tree+RF.Rmd: R Markdown lab accompanying the slides
   * PhotoZ.csv: photometric redshift and stellar mass data for 10,000 galaxies
   * StarQuasar.csv: ugriz magnitude data for 500 stars and 500 quasars
2. RFCDE_1804.05753.pdf: Pospisil &amp; Lee (2018), "RFCDE: Random Forests for Conditional Density Estimation"
